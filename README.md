## Artist | Gamer | Carer | Fledgling Coder

My name is Krystal Dales and i'm a fledgling coder with a background in the equine and art industry! My current life circumstances has inspired a change in career direction as both of those industries don't provide me with long term career prospects and I have been interested in learning to code ever since the age of 12 and getting into gaming (Would love to be an indie game developer someday!), but my parents non-techical background and caring duties stopped me from learning when I was younger. However I recently got a kick up the bum and decided that the next best time to learn would be now; so here I am taking a official DoE Course and also learning using free resources as well.

Below I have included the some links to my other endeavours to fill this out a little until I have some proper projects to add and as this is also a task for my course to just have a fiddle with the styling as well!

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on learning **<ins> software engineering</ins>** with **<ins>CoGrammer</ins>** and **<ins> HTML & CSS </ins>** with **<ins> FreeCodeCamp </ins>**!

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her They/Them <sub> Pretty much call me anything; Just don't call me late for tea! </sub>

âš¡ Fun Fact: I own a horse with my same name and spelled the same way! <sub> Isn't fate a funny thing!</sub>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **<ins>Building a tribute page</ins>** for **<ins>FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Course.</ins>**
